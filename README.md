# SONiC testbed management infrastructure
* The SONiC testbed consists of multiple interrelated configuration files that are difficult and error-prone edit manually.
* They are not frequently modified and only handful of persons like owners/admin has authority to modify them. But creating the initial setup or retrieving a broken setup is more challenging task for them.
* User scripts runs inside the docker container loads and access these files, and if the container is corrupted or crashed these files will be lost and will be difficult to get back easily. This will be challenging time for the user who doesnâ€™t have the knowledge of interrelationship of the files.
# So how do we onboard engineer to write tests?
* Keep the testbed files in the separate repository outside the SONiC docker image.
* Give a script to user 
  * That will sync his/her forked directory.
  * Overlay the test and configuration files inside the container.
